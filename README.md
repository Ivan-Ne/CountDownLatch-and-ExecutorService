# CountDownLatch-and-ExecutorService
On this task I used CountDownLatch and ExecutorService for better manage of threads.
CountDownLatch is used like a counter. Here I used it to control the finish of the 10 threads executing.
ExecutorService is used to control a number of executing threads. This is more efficient for the tasks with big amount of threads
